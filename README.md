# The Smart Garden - Automated Plant Care System
A fully automated irrigation system for plant care powered by IoT and sensors, built with the ESP8266 microcontroller. The system is remotely managed via the Blynk app and integrates several sensors to monitor and adjust environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity, and soil moisture.
# Features
Remote Management: Control and monitor the irrigation system remotely through the Blynk mobile app, making it easy to manage your garden anytime and anywhere.

Temperature and Humidity Monitoring: Utilizes the DHT11 sensor to monitor ambient temperature and humidity.

Soil Moisture Monitoring: Uses a soil moisture sensor to monitor the water content in the soil and adjust irrigation accordingly.

Cross-Device Compatibility: The app works seamlessly across multiple devices for a user-friendly experience.

Automatic Irrigation: The system is designed to automatically activate irrigation when the soil moisture falls below a set threshold.

# Technologies Used
ESP8266: A low-cost Wi-Fi microcontroller used to connect the system to the internet.

Blynk App: A mobile app for creating interfaces to control and monitor hardware remotely.

Soil Moisture Sensor: Measures the water content in the soil to trigger irrigation when necessary.

Realtime Database: Stores data on environmental conditions and user actions for real-time monitoring.

Programming Languages: C/C++ for development and integration of the system.
